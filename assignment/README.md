# Assignment

### Overview
Use [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to recreate the design from one of the list of applications below.

### List of Applications
- [CompStak](https://dribbble.com/shots/1735027-CompStak-Map-UI/attachments/279979)
- [Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/)
- [Automatic](https://dashboard.automatic.com/#/demo)
- [Sygic Travel](https://travel.sygic.com)

### Instructions
- You can use a grey rectangle or other placeholder for the mapâ€”no need to recreate the exact map. This assignment is more interested in the user interface surrounding the map.
- Don't worry about replicating logos and other images. But try to replicate colors and components (dropdowns, search inputs, buttons) as closely as you can
- See how far you can get in 3 hours and then feel free to stop, or keep going if you're having fun
- Using Figma, share your project with Nathan and Jeff (j@frankl.org)
